### Q1. Melatonin Agonist Target

Ramelteon exerts its hypnotic effect primarily by:

A. Positively modulating GABAA receptors at the BZD site  
B. Antagonizing OX1/OX2 orexin receptors  
C. Acting as an agonist at melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors  
D. Enhancing GABA synthesis in the CNS  

**Correct Answer:** C  

**Bloom’s Level:** Understand  
**Use:** iRAT  
**p-target:** 0.75  
**d-target:** ≥ 0.30

### Q2. Ramelteon vs BZDs – Abuse Potential

Which structural/pharmacologic feature best explains why **ramelteon is not a controlled substance** whereas many hypnotics are Schedule IV?

A. It has very low oral bioavailability.  
B. It acts selectively at MT1/MT2 receptors and does not modulate GABAA BZD sites.  
C. It is rapidly converted to diazepam, which has low abuse potential.  
D. It has an extremely long half-life, preventing euphoria.  

**Correct Answer:** B  

**Bloom’s Level:** Analyze  
**Use:** iRAT + TRAT  
**p-target:** 0.65–0.75  
**d-target:** ≥ 0.35  

**Rationale:**  
Melatonin agonists **lack GABAA/BZD modulation**, so they are not associated with BZD-like reinforcement and abuse.

### Q3. Orexin Antagonist Mechanism

Which statement best describes the mechanism of dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) such as suvorexant or daridorexant?

A. They directly open GABAA chloride channels without GABA.  
B. They block orexin OX1/OX2 receptors, reducing wake drive.  
C. They act as partial agonists at melatonin MT1/MT2 receptors.  
D. They are inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine site.  

**Correct Answer:** B  

**Bloom’s Level:** Understand  
**Use:** iRAT  
**p-target:** 0.70  
**d-target:** ≥ 0.30  

---

### Q4. Buspirone – Outlier Mechanism

Which statement about **buspirone** is MOST accurate from a medicinal chemistry/target perspective?

A. It is a benzodiazepine analog that binds the BZD site.  
B. It is a barbiturate analog with modified 5,5-disubstitution.  
C. It is a 5-HT1A partial agonist with an azaspirodecanedione scaffold.  
D. It is a melatonin agonist used primarily for insomnia.  

**Correct Answer:** C  

**Bloom’s Level:** Understand / Apply  
**Use:** iRAT + TRAT  
**p-target:** 0.70  
**d-target:** ≥ 0.30  

**Rationale:**  
Buspirone has an **azaspirodecanedione core** plus arylpiperazine side chain and acts as a **5-HT1A partial agonist**, not a sedative-hypnotic.

### Q5. Barbiturate SAR – C5 Substituents

In 5,5-disubstituted barbiturates, increasing the length and branching of the C5 side chains generally:

A. Decreases lipophilicity and potency  
B. Increases lipophilicity and potency, but can shorten duration by redistribution  
C. Eliminates CNS activity entirely  
D. Converts the compound into a melatonin agonist  

**Correct Answer:** B  

**Bloom’s Level:** Analyze  
**Use:** iRAT + TRAT  
**p-target:** 0.60–0.65  
**d-target:** ≥ 0.35  

**Rationale:**  
Bulkier, branched C5 substituents **increase lipophilicity and potency**, often enhancing rapid CNS entry and redistribution (short-acting thiobarbiturates).

---

### Q6. C2 Sulfur in Thiobarbiturates

Replacing the oxygen at the 2-position of a barbiturate ring with sulfur (forming a thiobarbiturate) typically:

A. Makes the drug more hydrophilic and slower to act  
B. Decreases potency and eliminates hypnotic action  
C. Increases lipophilicity and leads to faster onset  
D. Converts it into a selective melatonin agonist  

**Correct Answer:** C  

**Bloom’s Level:** Analyze  
**Use:** iRAT + TRAT  
**p-target:** 0.60  
**d-target:** ≥ 0.35  

---

### Q7. Safety Comparison – Mechanism-Based

Which pair correctly matches the sedative-hypnotic class with its **key safety concern**?

A. Ramelteon – dangerous respiratory depression at therapeutic doses  
B. Daridorexant – prominent anterograde amnesia similar to triazolam  
C. Phenobarbital – high overdose lethality due to direct GABAA activation at high doses  
D. Buspirone – severe withdrawal seizures on abrupt discontinuation  

**Correct Answer:** C  

**Bloom’s Level:** Analyze/Evaluate  
**Use:** TRAT  
**p-target:** 0.55–0.65  
**d-target:** ≥ 0.35  

**Rationale:**  
Barbiturates directly activate GABAA at high doses and have a **narrow therapeutic index** with high overdose lethality.

---

### Q8. Case – Substance Use Disorder + Insomnia

A patient with a history of benzodiazepine and alcohol misuse presents with chronic insomnia. Which agent is MOST appropriate from a mechanistic and abuse-liability standpoint?

A. Eszopiclone  
B. Lemborexant  
C. Ramelteon  
D. Phenobarbital  

**Correct Answer:** C  

**Bloom’s Level:** Evaluate  
**Use:** TRAT (team debate)  
**p-target:** 0.50–0.60  
**d-target:** ≥ 0.35  

**Rationale:**  
Ramelteon (melatonin agonist) has **no BZD/GABAA action and minimal abuse potential**, making it favorable in this context.

**Distractors:**  
A/B: Both controlled substances (C-IV).  
D: High lethality and abuse potential.

### Q9. Mechanistic Contrast – GABAA Requirement

Which statement best contrasts barbiturates and benzodiazepines at GABAA receptors?

A. Both require GABA present to increase Cl⁻ current and neither can directly activate the channel.  
B. Barbiturates can directly gate the channel at high doses, whereas benzodiazepines require GABA for effect.  
C. Benzodiazepines directly open the channel at high doses, whereas barbiturates are pure allosteric modulators.  
D. Neither barbiturates nor benzodiazepines affect channel gating, only receptor expression.  

**Correct Answer:** B  

**Bloom’s Level:** Analyze  
**Use:** TRAT  
**p-target:** 0.65  
**d-target:** ≥ 0.35
